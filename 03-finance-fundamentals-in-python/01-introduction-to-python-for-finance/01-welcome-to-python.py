# Why might you use Python in finance?
'''
Python is routinely used in financial quantitative analyses. What applications might you use Python for in finance?

Possible Answers
-To compile monthly sales reports
-To optimize an investment strategies performance
-Visualizing stock data trends
-All of the above

# All of the above

# Run code vs. submit answer
'''
On the right, you'll see the area where you can write and execute Python scripts and the IPython console. In this exercise, you will practice submitting code. The output of this code will be shown in the IPython Shell. The IPython Shell can also be used interactively to type and execute commands. The code entered directly in IPython shell is not checked for correctness, so it is a great place to experiment.
You can submit your script to check for correctness by hitting Submit Answer. Note that you can also use Take Hint or Show Answer if you're stuck.

Instructions
-Hit the Run Code button and observe that the code in your script is executed in the IPython Shell.
-Next, hit the Submit Answer to execute the code and check it against the solution.

# Example 1, do not modify!
print(8 / 2)

# Example 2, do not modify!
print(2**2)

# Printing output
'''
The print() function in a Python script explicitly prints the output. It is time to write your first line of Python code with and without the print() function to observe how it impacts the output of a script.

Instructions 1/2
-Write a command that adds 10 and 2.
Instructions 2/2
-Write a command that multiplies 10 and 2.
-Print this output explicitly.
'''
# Addition, no print output
10 + 2

# Multiplication, with print output
print(10 * 2)



# Finding the average revenue
'''
Variables can be used to store information and efficiently recover and manipulate stored values.
The revenue of three companies have been stored in three variables: revenue_1, revenue_2, and revenue_3.
Let's calculate the total revenue and the average revenue of these companies.

Instructions 1/2
-Create a new variable, total that represents the sum of revenue_1, revenue_2 and revenue_3.

Instructions 2/2
-Find the average of total.
'''
# Print the total revenue
total = revenue_1 + revenue_2 + revenue_3
print(total)

# Print the average revenue
average = total / 3
print(average)
