### 3 Linear Classifiers in Python
In this course you'll learn all about using linear classifiers, specifically logistic regression and support vector machines, with scikit-learn. Once you've learned how to apply these methods, you'll dive into the ideas behind them and find out what really makes them tick. At the end of this course you'll know how to train, test, and tune these linear classifiers in Python. You'll also have a conceptual foundation for understanding many other machine learning algorithms.



#### 3-1 Applying logistic regression and SVM
In this chapter you will learn the basics of applying logistic regression and support vector machines (SVMs) to classification problems. You'll use the scikit-learn library to fit classification models to real data.

#### 3-2 Loss functions
