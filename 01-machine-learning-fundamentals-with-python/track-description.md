# Skill Track: Machine Learning Fundamentals with Python
Machine learning is changing the world and if you want to be a part of the ML revolution, this is a great place to start! In this track, you’ll learn the fundamental concepts in Machine Learning.



### 1 Supervised Learning with scikit-learn
Machine learning is the field that teaches machines and computers to learn from existing data to make predictions on new data: Will a tumor be benign or malignant? Which of your customers will take their business elsewhere? Is a particular email spam? In this course, you'll learn how to use Python to perform supervised learning, an essential component of machine learning. You'll learn how to build predictive models, tune their parameters, and determine how well they will perform with unseen data—all while using real world datasets. You'll be using scikit-learn, one of the most popular and user-friendly machine learning libraries for Python.
