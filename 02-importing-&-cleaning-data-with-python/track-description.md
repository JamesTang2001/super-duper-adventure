# Skill Track: Importing & Cleaning Data with Python
Understanding how to prep your data is an essential skill for working in Python. It’s what you have to do before you can reveal the insights that matter. In this track, you’ll learn how to import your data from a variety of sources, including .csv, .xls, text files, and more. After learning how to import your data it’s time to prepare your data for analysis. You’ll work with real-world data such as restaurant reviews as you learn how to handle improper data types, deal with missing data, and perform record linkage. You’ll then learn how you can leverage the Tweepy package to access Twitter’s API to scrape the web for data. Start this track and gain the data prepping skills you need to clean your dirty data.



### 1 Introduction to Importing Data in Python
As a data scientist, you will need to clean data, wrangle and munge it, visualize it, build predictive models, and interpret these models. Before you can do so, however, you will need to know how to get data into Python. In this course, you'll learn the many ways to import data into Python: from flat files such as .txt and .csv; from files native to other software such as Excel spreadsheets, Stata, SAS, and MATLAB files; and from relational databases such as SQLite and PostgreSQL.

### 2 Intermediate Importing Data in Python
As a data scientist, you will need to clean data, wrangle and munge it, visualize it, build predictive models and interpret these models. Before you can do so, however, you will need to know how to get data into Python. In the prequel to this course, you learned many ways to import data into Python: from flat files such as .txt and .csv; from files native to other software such as Excel spreadsheets, Stata, SAS, and MATLAB files; and from relational databases such as SQLite and PostgreSQL. In this course, you'll extend this knowledge base by learning to import data from the web and by pulling data from Application Programming Interfaces— APIs—such as the Twitter streaming API, which allows us to stream real-time tweets.
